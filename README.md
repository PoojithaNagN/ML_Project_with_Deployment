## Project Overview

This project demonstrates an end-to-end machine learning workflow. It covers:
- Data preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Model building and evaluation
- Saving the model
- Deploying the model using a web framework (e.g., Flask or Streamlit)

## Technologies Used

- Jupyter Notebook
- Python
- PowerShell, Shell scripts
- JavaScript (for frontend or minor scripting)
- Roff

Common Python libraries:
- pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn
- Flask or Streamlit (for deployment)

## How to Run

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/PoojithaNagN/ML_Project_with_Deployment.git
   cd ML_Project_with_Deployment
Install dependencies:

bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
Open and run Jupyter notebooks for data processing and model training:

bash
jupyter notebook
# Open the notebook in your browser and run cells
Run the deployment app:

For Flask:
bash
cd app
python app.py
For Streamlit:
bash
streamlit run app.py
Deployment
The trained model is deployed as a web application for easy predictions on new data. See the app/ directory for deployment scripts.
